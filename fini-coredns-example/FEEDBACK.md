- Feedback is welcomed for this project and my others.
- Github issues are the preferred way.
- But given the tyranny of the algorithm I would never discourage you from making a comment on youtube.
- I have endeavored to follow best practices as much as possible.
  So if you notice anything that doesn't seem as good as it could be, let me know.
