Just is a command runner and task automation tool that serves as a modern
alternative to make. It uses a simple justfile format to define commands and
recipes, making it easy to document and run project-specific tasks like
building, testing, deployment, or cleanup. Unlike make, Just focuses purely on
command execution without build system complexity - no timestamps or dependency
tracking. It supports features like command-line arguments, environment
variables, recipe dependencies, and cross-platform compatibility. Just is
particularly popular among developers who want a straightforward way to
standardize common project workflows and share executable documentation with
their teams.
