DNSControl is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you manage
DNS records across multiple providers using a unified JavaScript-based
configuration format. Instead of manually updating DNS settings through web
interfaces, you define all your domains, records, and settings in code, then
deploy changes atomically. It supports major DNS providers like Cloudflare,
Route53, Google Cloud DNS, and many others. DNSControl provides validation,
diff previews, and rollback capabilities, making DNS management safer and more
reliable. It's particularly valuable for organizations managing multiple
domains or complex DNS configurations, enabling version control, automation,
and consistent DNS infrastructure management.
