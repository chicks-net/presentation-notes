# just features

* Doesnâ€™t require irritating configuration languages like XML, YAML, or JSON.
* Agnostic about tabs versus spaces.
* Support any scripting language of your choice.
* Just scripting looks very similar to shell scripting, but the defaults are safer.
    * Exits on error
    * Displays command being executed in bold
    * Self-documenting
* Build a shared set of tools without littering files all over your repo.
* Run the same code locally or in a github action, but maintain it in one place.  Don't repeat yourself.

## Downside

* Don't try to search for it.  **Just** go to the docs or the repo.  I could not find that other youtube video about `just` by searching.
