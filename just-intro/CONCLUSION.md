# Conclusion of just demo

`just` reduces developer toil without creating new problems.
It is great to see an evolved `make` that is worth the trouble of using.

Centralizing your small scripts leads to a neater repo and makes it
more likely that they will get used instead of forgotten.

I've used `just` in 4 different projects and it is something I want to keep evolving.
I also learned the github CLI (`gh` command) recently and it has been great
for accelerating my development process.
