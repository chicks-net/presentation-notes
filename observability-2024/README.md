* Observability in 2024

## Outline

* Executive Summary: Observability is vital to debugging complex applications.
* Who is Christopher Hicks?
* What is Observability?
    * Observability vs monitoring
* Who are the Observability players?
    * Datadog is expanding into every area they can acquire or build their way into.  Like AWS, the core product is pretty solid, but the many new beta products might be better to wait on.
    * Cisco is busy acquiring and trying to integrate and Observability business.
    * Honeycomb has an advanced product, but legacy support like unstructured logs has only recently been released.  Honeycomb is definitely a thought leader in this space.
    * Grafana has an excellent open source and cloud offering for your Observability platform.
* What about incident management?
    * FireHydrant and Incident.io are the leaders.
    * ZenDuty also has an interesting product.
    * Datadog's incident management is still beta/MVP-level.
    * Opsgenie's evolution under Atlassian has been disappointing.
* What is coming soon in Observability?
    * Tracking accuracy and latency for LLMs.
    * Other opportunities presented by AI.
    * More integrated "single panes of glass" for the whole business.
    * Open Telemetry (otel) will be the de facto ingestion method and vendor agents will recede.
